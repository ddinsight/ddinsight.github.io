DD insight can pull you out of darkness and provides you with insight into network quality and possible problems your users are experiencing, letting you monitor and analyze network side of service quality so that you can proactively seek out solutions to problems and ways to service enhancement.\r\n\r\nApp providers can identify network problems with analysis data provided by DD insight and use the data to work with network providers to solve problems and enhance network quality for your users.\r\n\r\nIf you're the provider of both the app and the network, then you don't have to entirely rely on monitoring devices on you network which only provides network-side perspective. Rather, you will be able to acquire data on network quality users actually experiences since data is provided by mobile devices themselves. Using this data, you will be able to find ways to enhance both network and services your app provides.\r\n\r\n**Who made this?**\r\n\r\n- [Kwangju Lee](https://github.com/kjlee501)  - dd-analytics/coreBatch and data architecture Lead\r\n- [Ethan Lee](https://github.com/mhb8436)  - dd-analytics all presentation Lead\r\n- [Spring Choi](https://github.com/springchoi)  - dd-streamworks and dd-collector/collectServer Lead\r\n- [Daniel Moon](https://github.com/sysmoon)  - dd-collector/mobileSDK Lead\r\n- [JS Song](https://github.com/jsong88) - DD Insight Product Lead\r\n- [Sang Yi](https://github.com/githubtofu)  - Math components, OSS projectization\r\n- [Aram Seo](https://github.com/seoaram)  - Contributed to dd-analytics/dataview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n---\r\nThe following three major sub-projects comprise DD insight.\r\n\r\n 1. **dd-collector**\r\n\t This is a module that collects and filters logs from smart devices and processes them using distributed system.\r\n\t \r\n 2. **dd-streamworks**\r\n\t This consists of real-time processing of logs and scalable job server.\r\n \r\n 3. **dd-analytics**\r\n\tThis consists of the batch process module for saved logs and the presentation module.\r\n\tThe presentation module is mainly for map-based visualization of output of QoE analysis based on results of batch process (Comprehensive presentation of results of real-time analysis can be provided in a commercial version)\r\n\r\n> *Process Diagram of DD Insight*\r\n> \r\n> ![Block Diagram of DD Insight](https://ddinsight.github.io/images/opendd_diag_tp.png)\r\n>\r\n> In this open source package of DD Insight, logs from mobile devices are collected and pre-processed by **dd-collector** and the data delivered to back-end are processed by **dd-streamworks** and **dd-analytics** and finally visualized by the presentation part of **dd-analytics** \r\n\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n---\r\n - [Data Format for Client-side logs](https://github.com/ddinsight/dd-collector/blob/master/SAMPLE-DATA-FORMAT.md) : Sample data format for event logs for live video streaming service\r\n\r\n - Sub-projects of DD insights\r\n\t - [dd-collector](http://github.com/ddinsight/dd-collector) : Collector Front-end Framework.\r\n\t - [dd-streamworks](http://github.com/ddinsight/dd-streamworks) : Real-time Processing & Job engine\r\n\t - [dd-analytics](http://github.com/ddinsight/dd-analytics) : Batch Processing & Presentation\r\n\t \r\n\t *Please refer to README.md from each of the above repositories for more details.*\r\n - [Tester App](http://github.com/ddinsight/dd-collector/mobilesdk/app) : An android app for testing operation of DD Insight framework. A part of dd-collector/mobilesdk.\r\n - [Live Demo](http://demo.ddinsight.io) : A Live Demo site for demonstrating DD Insight functionality. The site shows dynamically changing network quality status of Korean cellular networks by analyzing logs obtained from apps for services provided by AirPlug, Inc.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n---\r\n\r\n####Solutions\r\n\r\n**Network monitoring**\r\n\r\nBased on logs obtained from mobile devices of app users all over the world, you can monitor what's happening network-wise anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n**Network actions**\r\n\r\nIf there is a network problem to be addressed in a specific location or network segment, you can instantiate proper modules in your app to prevent or ease further problems, or if you have proper authority to control network itself, you can modify network configuration to address the network issue.\r\n\r\n**Customer experience management**\r\n\r\nYou can not only provide proper measures for customers who's already encountered the network issues but also provide proactive measures to prevent potential problems for customers deemed at risk of experiencing them.\r\n  \r\n####Applicable Services\r\n\r\n**Multimedia streaming**\r\n\r\nNetwork shortage or service disruption during video/audio streaming playback can be monitored and analyzed by collecting logs during service intervals.\r\n\r\n**Game on mobile network**\r\n\r\nNetwork problems during playing of games using network connection can be monitored and analyzed by collecting corresponding logs.\r\n\r\n**Web-based application**\r\n\r\nNetwork problems during dynamic web contents loading can be monitored and analyzed.\r\n\r\n**Connected-car services**\r\n\r\nNetwork problems while using telematics services and infotainment services can be monitored and analyzed through collection of logs from corresponding devices.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-70234859-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
