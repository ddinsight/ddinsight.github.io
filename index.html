<p><strong>What is DD insight?</strong></p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how network performance is affecting users of your app? DD insight can pull you out of darkness and provides you with insight into network quality and possible problems your users are experiencing, letting you monitor and analyze network side of service quality so that you can proactively seek out solutions to problems and ways to service enhancement.</p>

<p>App providers can identify network problems with analysis data provided by DD insight and use the data to work with network providers to solve problems and enhance network quality for your users.</p>

<p>If you're the provider of both the app and the network, then you don't have to entirely rely on monitoring devices on you network which only provides network-side perspective. Rather, you will be able to acquire data on network quality users actually experiences since data is provided by mobile devices themselves. Using this data, you will be able to find ways to enhance both network and services your app provides.</p>

<hr>

<p>The following three major sub-projects comprise DD insight.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>dd-collector</strong>
 This is a module that collects and filters logs from smart devices and processes them using distributed system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>dd-streamworks</strong>
 This consists of real-time processing of logs and scalable job server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>dd-analytics</strong>
This consists of the batch process module for saved logs and the presentation module.
The presentation module is mainly for map-based visualization of output of QoE analysis based on results of batch process (Comprehensive presentation of results of real-time analysis can be provided in a commercial version)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In this open source package of DD Insight, logs from mobile devices are collected and pre-processed by <strong>dd-collector</strong> and the data delivered to back-end are processed by <strong>dd-streamworks</strong> and <strong>dd-analytics</strong> and finally visualized by the presentation part of <strong>dd-analytics</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<p><em>Network monitoring</em></p>

<p>Based on logs obtained from mobile devices of app users all over the world, you can monitor what's happening network-wise anywhere in the world.</p>

<p><em>Network actions</em></p>

<p>If there is a network problem to be addressed in a specific location or network segment, you can instantiate proper modules in your app to prevent or ease further problems, or if you have proper authority to control network itself, you can modify network configuration to address the network issue.</p>

<p><em>Customer experience management</em></p>

<p>You can not only provide proper measures for customers who's already encountered the network issues but also provide proactive measures to prevent potential problems for customers deemed at risk of experiencing them.</p>

<p><strong>Applicable Services</strong></p>

<p><em>Multimedia streaming</em></p>

<p>Network shortage or service disruption during video/audio streaming playback can be monitored and analyzed by collecting logs during service intervals.</p>

<p><em>Game on mobile network</em></p>

<p>Network problems during playing of games using network connection can be monitored and analyzed by collecting corresponding logs.</p>

<p><em>Web-based application</em></p>

<p>Network problems during dynamic web contents loading can be monitored and analyzed.</p>

<p><em>Connected-car services</em></p>

<p>Network problems while using telematics services and infotainment services can be monitored and analyzed through collection of logs from corresponding devices.</p>
